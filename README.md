This is a single file stand-alone application using R Markdown.

It was run and tested using RStudio and the knitr package.

Use the file with the .Rmd extension as input, or examine the
file with the .html extension or the .nb.html extension to see
what the output is like.

There are several small text files that you need in addition to
the Rmd file.

You should also have the jags software and the rjags package
installed on your computer. See the Rmd file for details.

This application does not need any special files beyond the
ones listed above.
